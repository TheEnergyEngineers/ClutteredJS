% The evaluation will be done using the following method. A dataset containing 500 cluttered and 500 decluttered web pages will be used to sample a smaller set of webpages ${\sim}40$. 
% Then the first experiment will be to collect the energy consumption of loading the cluttered and decluttered web pages. Comparing this data will give an answer to our research question. An additional experiment will be to also measure the energy consumption of the decluttering process of JSCleaner. We can then 1) divide the energy consumption of the decluttering by the average amount of visitors per web page, then 2) add this to the energy consumption of loading the decluttered web page, and then 3) compare this again to the cluttered energy consumption.
